Hey, I’m an RF Engineer with a passion for wireless technology and a knack for wireless module design, amplifier optimization, and all things RF. I’ve worked on projects ranging from Power Amplifier and Low-Noise Amplifier design to filtering and impedance matching, always aiming to push the limits of system performance. Outside of engineering, I’m a motorcycle enthusiast, and I love working on mechanical projects, hiking, traveling, and keeping up with the latest tech trends. After serving in the Army and welcoming a newborn, I enjoy the balance of work, family, and adventure.
