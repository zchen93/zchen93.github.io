# A USB-C Multi-Slot SD Reader
I recently started a fun DIY project to build a USB Type-C multi-SD card reader. The goal is to create a compact device that can handle multiple SD cards via one Type-C connection, simplifying the process of transferring files from various cards. I'm currently exploring different SD formats, optimizing for fast data transfer, and ensuring the design is as simple and cost-effective as possible. It’s a hands-on project, and I’m excited to see how it all comes together.

For the schematic and layout, I’m using Altium Designer. Before capturing the schematic, I plan to draft a block diagram to map out the design. Since this is a brand-new project, I spent time researching online for inspiration, and I found a great article, ["Design Your Own USB-MicroSD Card Reader PCB"](https://resources.altium.com/p/design-your-own-usb-microsd-card-reader-pcb), which provides detailed guidance on producing a layout in Altium Designer for a similar product.

A key part of the design is selecting the right USB 3.2-to-SD controller chip. After some research and a helpful conversation with ChatGPT, I found two promising options: the [Algor AU84610](https://www.algoltek.com.tw/product-list-129-132-product36) and the [JMicron JMS581SD](https://www.jmicron.com/products/list/19). Unfortunately, neither part seems readily available in the US, and I couldn’t locate the datasheet or CAD model for the AU84610. I’ve reached out to their sales department in Taiwan and am awaiting further updates.
