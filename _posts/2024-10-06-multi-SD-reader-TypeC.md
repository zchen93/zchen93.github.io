# A USB-C Multi-Slot SD Reader
I began working on a fun DIY project to build a USB Type-C multi-SD card reader. The idea is to create a compact gadget that can handle multiple SD cards through one Type-C connection, making it easier to transfer files from various cards at once. I’m exploring different SD formats, fast data transfer, and how to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible. It’s a hands-on project, and I look forward to seeing how it comes together. 

The schematic and layout tool selected is the Altium Designer. Before capturing the schematic, I would start drafting the block diagram. Since this design is completely new, I spent some time reading online to find inspirations for the USB-to-SD reader block diagram. This article [Design your own USB-MicroSD Card Reader PCB](https://resources.altium.com/p/design-your-own-usb-microsd-card-reader-pcb) provided great details on how to produce a layout in Altium Designer for a similar product. 

It's also imperative to understand the options for USB 3.2-to-SD controller chips. After spending some time online and asking ChatGPT, the [Algor AU84610](https://www.algoltek.com.tw/product-list-129-132-product36) and [JMicron JMS581LT](https://www.jmicron.com/products/list/19) would serve the purpose well. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the data sheet and the CAD model for AU84610 online, so I called their sales department in Taiwan. [To be updated]
