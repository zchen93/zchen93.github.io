# Building a Power Amplifier for Wi-Fi: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands

Goal: Building a dual-band Wi-Fi PA PCBA to sharpen skills in using CAD and RF Simulation software. Also, to gain intuitional proficiency in biasing and matching the PA. 

Tools needed: 
- Altium Designer
- Pathwave ADS
- PCBWay
- Transistor: https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=TAV1-541%2B

Components needed:
1. Lump L (2.4 GHz)
2. Lump C (2.4 GHz)
3. Transistor (SiGe or GaAs)
4. SMA Connectors x3 - 1 for 2.4 GHz input, 1 for 5 GHz input, 1 for output
5. Bias lines
6. RF Switch

Approach: 
1. Pick the transistor (Mini-Circuits TAV1-541+ is likely the choice.)
   1.1: Does the TAV1-541+ have a CAD model in Altium?
   1.2: How can we model it in ADS?

2. Analyze the S-Parameters at target frequencies, i.e., 2450 MHz and 5850 (?) MHz. 
2.1: [2412, 2484] MHz, BW: 72 MHz, f_{c} = 2448 MHz\
   2.1.1: Assuming $$\epsilon_{r} = 10, \epsilon_{e} = 5.5, \lambda = 52.26 mm, \lambda/4 = 13.065 mm $$ \
2.2: [5160, 5885] MHz, BW: 725 MHz, f_{c} = 5523 MHz\
   2.2.1: Assuming $$\epsilon_{r} = 10, \epsilon_{e} = 5.5, \lambda = 23.16 mm, \lambda/4 = 5.79 mm $$\

3. Identify stability/instability at the design frequencies.
   3.1 At f = 2450 MHz, K = 0.7281 < 1, |$$\Delta$$| = 0.361 < 1
   3.2 At f = 5520 MHz, K = 1.08 > 1, |$$\Delta$$| = 0.3895 < 1
   

0. Authorized maximum power output level: 30dBm. 

Tasks
