# Measuring S-Parameters using VNA
1. Question: What would happen on the measured $$S_{11}$$ if a 10-dB attenuator is attached to the DUT's input?
Definition: $$ S_{11} = \frac{V_{1}^{-}}{V_{1}^{+}} $$ given $$ V_{2}^{+} = 0 $$, reflected voltage over the incident voltage. $$ P^{-} = |\Gamma|^{2} P^{+} $$. Here, $$ \Gamma = S_{11} $$.
