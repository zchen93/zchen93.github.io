# A USB-C Multi-Slot SD Reader
I began working on a fun DIY project to build a USB Type-C multi-SD card reader. The idea is to create a compact gadget that can handle multiple SD cards through one Type-C connection, making it easier to transfer files from various cards at once. I’m exploring different SD formats, fast data transfer, and how to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible. It’s a hands-on project, and I look forward to seeing how it comes together. 

The schematic and layout tool selected is the Altium Designer. Before capturing the schematic, I would start drafting the block diagram. Since this design is completely new to me, I spent some time reading online to find inspirations of the USB-to-SD reader block diagram.
