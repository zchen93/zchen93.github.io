# Measuring S-Parameters using VNA
I. Passive Device

II. Active Device
1. Question: What would happen on the measured $$S_{11}$$ if a 10-dB attenuator is attached to the device's input?
Definition: $$ S_{11} = \frac{V^{-}}{V^{+}} $$, reflected voltage over the incident voltage. $$ P^{-} = |\Gamma|^{2} P^{+}|.
